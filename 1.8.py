# Write a program that displays the area and perimeter of a circle that has a radius of 5.5
# using the following formula
# area = radius * radius * pi
# perimeter = 2 * radius * pi

radius = 5.5
area = 3.14 * radius * radius
perimeter = 2 * radius * 3.14

print("The area of a circle with radius",radius, "is",area)
print("The perimeter of a circle with area",area, "is",perimeter)
